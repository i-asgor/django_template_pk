Padakhep's program interventions are developed or designed in line with Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan (PRSP) and Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for addressing the priority issues like education, human resource development, microfinance, agriculture & environment, health & sanitation, child development, etc of the beneficiaries. Unlike many other NGOs in the country which are confined to Minimalist approach (only Microcredit), Padakhep is promoting or pursuing a Maximalist approach (Microcredit plus HDA approach) to break the vicious cycle of poverty. Padakhep strongly believes that HDA is the most appropriate strategy for sustainable development of the poor and the community as a whole.</p>
